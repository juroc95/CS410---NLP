# Story Continuation

Created a text generation language model that can generate text in the style of old-fashioned literature to see if text generation can be used in the literature story continuation. We used GPT-2 as a language model, PG-19 dataset as training data, and single word perplexity for language model evaluation. The PG-19 dataset contains a set of books published before 1919 extracted from the Project Gutenberg books project.

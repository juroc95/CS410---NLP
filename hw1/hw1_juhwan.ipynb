In my opinion, simply how many times a certain word appears in a headline is not enough for sarcasm detection. To give more information to the learning model, N-gram and punctuation-to-text techniques were used, but although there was a slight improvement in accuracy and F score, it was not enough to extract the performance of the late 90%. Since sarcasm detection is closely related to emotion, better accuracy and F score are likely to be extracted if NRC emotion features are used to provide emo words and emo intensity as additional features to the learning model."]}]}

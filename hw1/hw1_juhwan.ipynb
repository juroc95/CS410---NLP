It is believed that simply counting the number of times a certain word appears in a headline is not sufficient for sarcasm detection. To provide additional information to the learning model, techniques such as N-grams and punctuation-to-text were used. However, although there was a slight improvement in accuracy and F-score, it was not enough to achieve a performance level of 90%. Sarcasm detection is closely related to emotions, thus, it is likely that better accuracy and F-score can be achieved by using NRC emotion features to provide emo words and emo intensity as additional features to the learning model."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"collapsed_sections":[],"machine_shape":"hm","name":"hw1.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

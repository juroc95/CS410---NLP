# Natural Language Processing

CS 410/510 Top: Natural Language Processing

This course provides a broad introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP), which enables automatic processing of natural (human) language text. The students will learn about a variety of key models and algorithms that are available for reasoning about text in computational systems. NLP is useful in many exciting real-world applications including machine translation, sentiment analysis, conversational AI, question answering, recommender systems, Internet search and many more. We will cover topics such as linguistic analysis (e.g., syntactic parsing, semantic analysis, coreference resolution), language models (e.g., word2vec, BERT) and neural approaches for NLP. The students will gain practical experience implementing key components of an NLP pipeline including text preprocessing, part-of-speech tagging, topic modeling and so on.
